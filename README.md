This has been cloned with the primary intention of formatting all chapters for Markdown, as well as typographic cleanupâ€”using en and em-dashes, quote marks, ellipses, actual roman numerals, removing redundant spaces, etc.

This is being typeset according to American style (and, I am told, what is not uncommon for British fiction style). All other British spelling and expressions are otherwise unchanged.
